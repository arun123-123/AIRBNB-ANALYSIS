PROBLEM STATEMENT

  This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visjualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO

  Establish a MongoDB connection retrieve the Airbnb Dataset and ensure efficient data retrieval for analysis.

  Clean and prepare the dataset addressing missing values, duplicates and data type conversions for accurate analysis.

  Develop a streamlit web application with interactove maps showcasing the distribution og Airbnb listings allowing users to explore prices, ratings and other relevant factores.

  Conduct price analysis and visualization, exploring variations based on location, property type and seasons using dynamic plots and charts.

  Analyze availability patterns across seasons, visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations using suitable visulizations.

  Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visulizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.

  Create interactive visualizations that enabl users to filter and drill down into the data.

  Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or PowerBI, combining various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.

CREATE A MONGODB ATLAS ACCOUNT

  Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account by visiting the MongoDB Atlas website and follow the registration process to set up your account and create a new project.
  
SET UP A CLUSTER  

  Wihin your MongoDB Atlas project, set up a cluster. Choose the cloud provider and region for hosting your data, and region for hosting your data, configure the cluster specifications and create the cluster.  This will serve as the database environment for storing the sample data.

LOAD THE AIRBNB SAMPLE DATA

  Once your cluster is set up, access the MongoDB Atlas dashboard.  In the left-hand navigtion menu, click on "Database Access" to create a database user with appropriate permissions for accessing and loading data. Then, select "Network Access" to set up IP whitelisting or configure other security measures.

IMPORT SAMPLE DATA

  From the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, navigate to the "Clusters" page and click on your cluster.  In the cluster view, select the "Collections" tab and click on the "Sample Data" button.  Choose the "Load Sample Dataset" option and MongoDB Atlas will import  the Airbnb sample data into your cluster. The sample data typically includes collections for listings reviews and users.

APPROACH

  MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval:

    Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.  Perform queriesw and data retrieval operations to extract the necessary information for your analysis.

  DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION:

    Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transoforming data tyupes as necessary. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
    
  GEOSPATIAL VISUALIZATION: 

    Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps. Visualizxe the distribution of listings across different locations, allowing users to explore prices, ratings and other relevant factors.

  PRICE ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION:

    Use the cleaned data to analyze and visuzlize ow prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends, outliers and correlations with other variables.

  AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS BY SEASON:

    Analyze the availbility of Airbnb listings based on seasonal variations.  Visualize the occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations throughout the year using line charts, heat maps, or other suitable visulizations.

  LOCATION-BASED INSIGHTS:

    Investigate how the price of listings varies across different locations.  Use MongoDb queries and data aggregation techniques to extract relevant information for specific regions or neighborhoods.  Visulize these insights on interactive maps or create dashboards in tools like Tableau or PowerBI.

  INTERACTIVE VISULIZATIONS:

    Develop dynamic and interactive visualizations that allow users to filter and drill down into the data based on their preferences.  Enable users to interact with the visualizations to explore specific regions, property types, or time periods of interest.

  DASHBOARD CREATIONS:

    Utilize Tableau or PowerBI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents keuy insights from your analysis.  Combine different visulizations, such as maps, charts and tables, to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns
